            <p>Pig Dice is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scame in 1945. As with many games of folk origin,
              Pig is played with many rule variations. Commercial variants of Pig include Pass the Pig, Pig Dice, and Skunk.
              Pig is commonly used by mathematics teachers to teach probability concepts. Pig is one of a family of dice
              games described as "jeopardy dice games".</p>

            <p>For jeopardy dice games, the dominant type of decision is whether or not to jeopardize previous gains by rolling
              for potential greater gains. </p>
            <h3 class="h3Title">Below are the Game Instructions:</h3>
            <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a diceÂ until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":</p>
            <ol class="listClass">
              <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
              <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
              <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</p>
            <p>For example, the first player, Anne, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Anne could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll
              again. Anne rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Anne rolls a 1, and must
              end her turn without scoring. The next player, Bob, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which he chooses to hold, and adds
              his turn total of 22 points to his score.</p>
